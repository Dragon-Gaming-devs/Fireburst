## Features

<em><strong><cite>Fireburst OS</cite></strong></em> is a Desktop environment in the browser with a VFS that aims to support as many filetypes as possible via WASM, [Cheerpx](http://cheerpx.io), [Cheerp](http://cheerp.io) and [Cheerpj](http://Cheerpj.com). This can include some desktop applications, namely linux ELF files. <em>Fireburst</em> also aims to provide other similar services such as [BrowserCode](https://github.com/leaningtech/browsercode/), Github PAT Integration, and secure browsers such as [Scramjet](http://github.com/mercuryworkshop/scramjet) and [Ultraviolet](http://github.com/titanitumnetwork-dev/ultraviolet). Perhaps most importantly of all, <em>Fireburst</em> is designed to run on github pages making it *very* easy to deploy.
